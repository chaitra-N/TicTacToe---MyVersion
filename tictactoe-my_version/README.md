# Tic Tac Toe -- My Version 

This project was boinspired by React doc tico tac toe game.

## Why two versions 

I came across react Doc after learning react from coding Addict on youtube.

Albiet the fundamentals I learnt were the same, there were a few differences and I wanted to test out which method/version I was more comfortable in. 

### Findings
